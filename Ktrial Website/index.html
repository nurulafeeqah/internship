<h1>Hogwarts Houses</h1>

<P>Hogwarts was founded over a thousand years ago by four powerful wizards: 
    Godric Gryffindor, Salazar Slytherin, Rowena Ravenclaw and Helga Hufflepuff. 
    They chose to split the students into four ‘houses’, each bearing their surnames 
    and featuring young wizards and witches who displayed abilities and personalities they
    wanted to nurture.</P>

<p>Houses at Hogwarts were both the living and learning communities for its students. Each year's 
    group of students in the same House shares the same dormitory and many classes. The houses compete 
    throughout the school year, by earning and losing points for behaviour. The House with the most 
    points wins the House Cup. Each House also has its own Quidditch team that competes for the Inter-House 
    Quidditch Cup. </p>

<p>In the early days of Hogwarts, the four founders handpicked students for their Houses. 
    When the founders worried how students would be selected after their deaths, Godric Gryffindor 
    took his hat off and each "put some brains" in it, creating the Sorting Hat to choose future 
    students for each House. At the beginning of each school year, the magical Sorting Hat is placed 
    on each new student's head during the Sorting ceremony. The Sorting Hat announces the House the 
    student is to join.</p>
